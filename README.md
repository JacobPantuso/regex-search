<h1 align="center">Regex Search</h1>

A simple yet easy-to-use Regex Matching tool. It takes a regular expression in as input and will attempt to match/search the given text.

## How to Use?
<hd>
You are free to visit www.jacobpantuso.ca/regex-search/index.html to use the deployed `vue.js` app for free.

## How is this built?
This program uses a combination of `vue.js` and regular `javascript` functions as I am not super familliar with `vue.js`. I will be updating this repo
to implement `vue.js` fully once I learn more.
